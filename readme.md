**Natural Language Processing**

Pre processing Data:

1. Tokenizing: Seperating of words or sentences.
2. Stop Words: Getting rid of useless words
3. Stemming: Converting all words into root.
4. Lemmatization: Better than stemming.
5. Spech Tagging: Making tuples of words with their tags(nouns, adverbs, adjectives)
6. Chunking: Grouping of similar grammar together
7. Chinking: Grouping of similar grammar together by selecting all and removing certain kind out.
8. Named Entity Recognition: Alternative to chunking/chinking.
